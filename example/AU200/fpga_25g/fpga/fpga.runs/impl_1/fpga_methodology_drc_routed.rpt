CLKC-56#1 Advisory
MMCME4 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME4_ADV cell clk_mmcm_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) bufg_gt_refclk_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
