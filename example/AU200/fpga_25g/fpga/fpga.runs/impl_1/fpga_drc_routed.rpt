Net qsfp1_phy_4_inst/phy_inst/inst_ipg_read_proc/fd/adrq/dst_port__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin qsfp1_phy_4_inst/phy_inst/inst_ipg_read_proc/fd/adrq/dst_port_reg[5]_i_1__6/O, cell qsfp1_phy_4_inst/phy_inst/inst_ipg_read_proc/fd/adrq/dst_port_reg[5]_i_1__6. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
